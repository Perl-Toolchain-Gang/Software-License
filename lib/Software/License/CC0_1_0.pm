B<You should really think hard before using this license.>

This license is provided for those who want to place their software into the
public domain.  Doing this means you have waived any copyright protection as
much as allowed by law, and that you grant anybody the right to do anything
with your software.  You cannot reverse your decision to dedicate software as
public property, so use this only if you're quite sure that you mean to do
it.
